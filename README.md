## Important note about the future of TweetFromX
As of writing this (November 23th 2020), I will no longer be bringing new updates for TweetFromX (PC version). I feel like this software is as good enough.
I have put a halt to the promised features that can be found on the releases page in v1.1. However, if there's either a requested issue or a pull request I will definitely bring those to TweetFromX. I haven't worked 2 months on this program and after returning to it I see a horrible codebase. If you feel like something feels off on the code feel free to do a pull request and I'll review it. This will also affect the Android version too.

## Guide on getting this code running on NetBeans.
hi if youre from the future and seeing this out of curiosity this is a wip atm.

## FAQ

#### Q: Why Java?
Most people have Java installed, so I guess this langauge is the perfect fit (and let's not forget this project was made for educative purposes so.. yeah!)

#### Q: your code sucks lol
it's been really a long while since i haven't written in java and i kinda forgot some stuff. if you feel like something's wrong feel free to send feedback via pull requests, i'll gladly check it out!

#### Q: Twitter API v2 is gonna be a thing, and Twitter4J uses v1.1, what will happen?
Yeah, no worries. Twitter is apparently planning to make their own library for some programming languages (like Java) with support for Twitter API v2 so no worries. Either I'll use that (and rewrite the twtAPI.java file) or still use Twitter4J if they update their library to support v2.

#### Q: Android app support since it's on Java? 
Of course! I'm working on one right now and soon I'll link it once I finish it.
