**FAQ**:

**Q: Why Java?**
**A:** Most people have Java installed, so I guess this langauge is the perfect fit (and let's not forget this project was made for educative purposes so.. yeah!)

**Q: your code sucks lol**
**A:** it's been really a long while since i haven't written in java and i kinda forgot some stuff. if you feel like something's wrong feel free to send feedback via pull requests, i'll gladly check it out!

**Q: I posted the tweet in the program but there's no error, help!**
**A:** I know about this and I will implement GUI errors soon. Please keep in mind I can't do it the next day, maybe next month or years because I have other important stuff to focus on, like school.

**Q: Twitter API v2 is gonna be a thing, and Twitter4J uses v1.1, what will happen?**
**A:** I haven't comprehended all of this Twitter API v2 yet but if replaces (and removes) the v1.1, this program will not work anymore UNLESS: 
**A)** Twitter4J gets updated to support v2, or **B)** I use another Twitter API Java Library that does support the new Twitter API Vv2.
